configuration from its parent module.

the name of the AWS region configured on the provider.

```hcl
data "aws_region" "current" {}
```

regions. The given filters must match exactly one region whose data will be
exported as attributes.

* `endpoint` - (Optional) The EC2 endpoint of the region to select.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
