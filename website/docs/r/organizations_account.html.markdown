# Resource: aws_organizations_account

Provides a resource to create a member account in the current organization.

~> **Note:** Account management must be done from the organization's master account.

!> **WARNING:** Deleting this Terraform resource will only remove an AWS account from an organization. Terraform will not close the account. The member account must be prepared to be a standalone account beforehand. See the [AWS Organizations documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html) for more information.

## Example Usage:

```hcl
resource "aws_organizations_account" "account" {
  name  = "my_new_account"
  email = "john@doe.org"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A friendly name for the member account.
* `email` - (Required) The email address of the owner to assign to the new member account. This email address must not already be associated with another AWS account.
* `iam_user_access_to_billing` - (Optional) If set to `ALLOW`, the new account enables IAM users to access account billing information if they have the required permissions. If set to `DENY`, then only the root user of the new account can access account billing information.
* `parent_id` - (Optional) Parent Organizational Unit ID or Root ID for the account. Defaults to the Organization default Root ID. A configuration must be present for this argument to perform drift detection.
* `role_name` - (Optional) The name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically preconfigures in the new member account. This role trusts the master account, allowing users in the master account to assume the role, as permitted by the master account administrator. The role has administrator permissions in the new member account. The Organizations API provides no method for reading this information after account creation, so Terraform cannot perform drift detection on its value and will always show a difference for a configured value after import unless [`ignore_changes`](/docs/configuration/resources.html#ignore_changes) is used.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN for this account.
* `id` - The AWS account id

## Import

The AWS member account can be imported by using the `account_id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_organizations_account.my_org 111111111111
```

Certain resource arguments, like `role_name`, do not have an Organizations API method for reading the information after account creation. If the argument is set in the Terraform configuration on an imported resource, Terraform will always show a difference. To workaround this behavior, either omit the argument from the Terraform configuration or use [`ignore_changes`](/docs/configuration/resources.html#ignore_changes) to hide the difference, e.g.

```hcl
resource "aws_organizations_account" "account" {
  name      = "my_new_account"
  email     = "john@doe.org"
  role_name = "myOrganizationRole"

  # There is no AWS Organizations API for reading role_name
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = ["role_name"]
  }
}
```
