Manages a RDS DB Instance association with an IAM Role. Example use cases:

* [Amazon RDS Oracle integration with Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-s3-integration.html)
* [Importing Amazon S3 Data into an RDS PostgreSQL DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PostgreSQL.S3Import.html)

-> To manage the RDS DB Instance IAM Role for [Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html), see the `aws_db_instance` resource `monitoring_role_arn` argument instead.

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance_role_association" "example" {
  db_instance_identifier = "${aws_db_instance.example.id}"
  feature_name           = "S3_INTEGRATION"
  role_arn               = "${aws_iam_role.example.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `db_instance_identifier` - (Required) DB Instance Identifier to associate with the IAM Role.

* `role_arn` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Role to associate with the DB Instance.
