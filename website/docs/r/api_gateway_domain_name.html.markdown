  Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway.

# Resource: aws_api_gateway_domain_name

Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway. Additional information about this functionality
can be found in the [API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html).

This resource just establishes ownership of and the TLS settings for
a particular domain name. An API can be attached to a particular path
under the registered domain name using
[the `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` resource](api_gateway_base_path_mapping.html).

API Gateway domains can be defined as either 'edge-optimized' or 'regional'.  In an edge-optimized configuration,
API Gateway internally creates and manages a CloudFront distribution to route requests on the given hostname. In
addition to this resource it's necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the given domain name which is an alias
(either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the Cloudfront domain name exported in the `cloudfront_domain_name`
attribute.

In a regional configuration, API Gateway does not create a CloudFront distribution to route requests to the API, though
a distribution can be created if needed. In either case, it is necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the
given domain name which is an alias (either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the regional domain name exported in
the `regional_domain_name` attribute.

~> **Note:** API Gateway requires the use of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates instead of Identity and Access Management (IAM) certificates in regions that support ACM. Regions that support ACM can be found in the [Regions and Endpoints Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#acm_region). To import an existing private key and certificate into ACM or request an ACM certificate, see the [`aws_acm_certificate` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/acm_certificate.html).

~> **Note:** All arguments including the private key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.

## Example Usage

### Edge Optimized (ACM Certificate)

```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_domain_name" "example" {
  certificate_arn = "${aws_acm_certificate_validation.example.certificate_arn}"
  domain_name     = "api.example.com"
}

# Example DNS record using Route53.
# Route53 is not specifically required; any DNS host can be used.
resource "aws_route53_record" "example" {
  name    = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.domain_name}"
  type    = "A"
  zone_id = "${aws_route53_zone.example.id}"

  alias {
    evaluate_target_health = true
    name                   = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.cloudfront_domain_name}"
    zone_id                = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.cloudfront_zone_id}"
  }
}
```

### Edge Optimized (IAM Certificate)

```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_domain_name" "example" {
  domain_name = "api.example.com"

  certificate_name        = "example-api"
  certificate_body        = "${file("${path.module}/example.com/example.crt")}"
  certificate_chain       = "${file("${path.module}/example.com/ca.crt")}"
  certificate_private_key = "${file("${path.module}/example.com/example.key")}"
}

# Example DNS record using Route53.
# Route53 is not specifically required; any DNS host can be used.
resource "aws_route53_record" "example" {
  zone_id = "${aws_route53_zone.example.id}" # See aws_route53_zone for how to create this

  name = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.domain_name}"
  type = "A"

  alias {
    name                   = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.cloudfront_domain_name}"
    zone_id                = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.cloudfront_zone_id}"
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
}
```

### Regional (ACM Certificate)

```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_domain_name" "example" {
  domain_name              = "api.example.com"
  regional_certificate_arn = "${aws_acm_certificate_validation.example.certificate_arn}"

  endpoint_configuration {
    types = ["REGIONAL"]
  }
}

# Example DNS record using Route53.
# Route53 is not specifically required; any DNS host can be used.
resource "aws_route53_record" "example" {
  name    = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.domain_name}"
  type    = "A"
  zone_id = "${aws_route53_zone.example.id}"

  alias {
    evaluate_target_health = true
    name                   = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.regional_domain_name}"
    zone_id                = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.regional_zone_id}"
  }
}
```

### Regional (IAM Certificate)

```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_domain_name" "example" {
  certificate_body          = "${file("${path.module}/example.com/example.crt")}"
  certificate_chain         = "${file("${path.module}/example.com/ca.crt")}"
  certificate_private_key   = "${file("${path.module}/example.com/example.key")}"
  domain_name               = "api.example.com"
  regional_certificate_name = "example-api"

  endpoint_configuration {
    types = ["REGIONAL"]
  }
}

# Example DNS record using Route53.
# Route53 is not specifically required; any DNS host can be used.
resource "aws_route53_record" "example" {
  name    = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.domain_name}"
  type    = "A"
  zone_id = "${aws_route53_zone.example.id}"

  alias {
    evaluate_target_health = true
    name                   = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.regional_domain_name}"
    zone_id                = "${aws_api_gateway_domain_name.example.regional_zone_id}"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `id` - The internal id assigned to this domain name by API Gateway.
* `certificate_upload_date` - The upload date associated with the domain certificate.
* `cloudfront_domain_name` - The hostname created by Cloudfront to represent
  the distribution that implements this domain name mapping.
* `cloudfront_zone_id` - For convenience, the hosted zone ID (`Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`)
  that can be used to create a Route53 alias record for the distribution.
* `regional_domain_name` - The hostname for the custom domain's regional endpoint.
* `regional_zone_id` - The hosted zone ID that can be used to create a Route53 alias record for the regional endpoint.

## Import
