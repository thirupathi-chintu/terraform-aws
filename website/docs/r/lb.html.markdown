# Resource: aws_lb

Provides a Load Balancer resource.

~> **Note:** `aws_alb` is known as `aws_lb`. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

### Application Load Balancer

```hcl
resource "aws_lb" "test" {
  name               = "test-lb-tf"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = ["${aws_security_group.lb_sg.id}"]
  subnets            = ["${aws_subnet.public.*.id}"]

  enable_deletion_protection = true

  access_logs {
    bucket  = "${aws_s3_bucket.lb_logs.bucket}"
    prefix  = "test-lb"
    enabled = true
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
```

### Network Load Balancer

```hcl
resource "aws_lb" "test" {
  name               = "test-lb-tf"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "network"
  subnets            = ["${aws_subnet.public.*.id}"]

  enable_deletion_protection = true

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
```

### Specifying Elastic IPs

```hcl
resource "aws_lb" "example" {
  name               = "example"
  load_balancer_type = "network"

  subnet_mapping {
    subnet_id     = "${aws_subnet.example1.id}"
    allocation_id = "${aws_eip.example1.id}"
  }

  subnet_mapping {
    subnet_id     = "${aws_subnet.example2.id}"
    allocation_id = "${aws_eip.example2.id}"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the LB. This name must be unique within your AWS account, can have a maximum of 32 characters,
must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, and must not begin or end with a hyphen. If not specified,
Terraform will autogenerate a name beginning with `tf-lb`.
* `name_prefix` - (Optional) Creates a unique name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `name`.
* `internal` - (Optional) If true, the LB will be internal.
* `load_balancer_type` - (Optional) The type of load balancer to create. Possible values are `application` or `network`. The default value is `application`.
* `security_groups` - (Optional) A list of security group IDs to assign to the LB. Only valid for Load Balancers of type `application`.
* `access_logs` - (Optional) An Access Logs block. Access Logs documented below.
* `subnets` - (Optional) A list of subnet IDs to attach to the LB. Subnets
cannot be updated for Load Balancers of type `network`. Changing this value 
for load balancers of type `network` will force a recreation of the resource. 
* `subnet_mapping` - (Optional) A subnet mapping block as documented below.
* `idle_timeout` - (Optional) The time in seconds that the connection is allowed to be idle. Only valid for Load Balancers of type `application`. Default: 60.
* `enable_deletion_protection` - (Optional) If true, deletion of the load balancer will be disabled via
   the AWS API. This will prevent Terraform from deleting the load balancer. Defaults to `false`.
* `enable_cross_zone_load_balancing` - (Optional) If true, cross-zone load balancing of the load balancer will be enabled.
   This is a `network` load balancer feature. Defaults to `false`.
* `enable_http2` - (Optional) Indicates whether HTTP/2 is enabled in `application` load balancers. Defaults to `true`.
* `ip_address_type` - (Optional) The type of IP addresses used by the subnets for your load balancer. The possible values are `ipv4` and `dualstack`
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

~> **NOTE::** Please note that internal LBs can only use `ipv4` as the ip_address_type. You can only change to `dualstack` ip_address_type if the selected subnets are IPv6 enabled.

Access Logs (`access_logs`) support the following:

* `bucket` - (Required) The S3 bucket name to store the logs in.
* `prefix` - (Optional) The S3 bucket prefix. Logs are stored in the root if not configured.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Boolean to enable / disable `access_logs`. Defaults to `false`, even when `bucket` is specified.

Subnet Mapping (`subnet_mapping`) blocks support the following:

* `subnet_id` - (Required) The id of the subnet of which to attach to the load balancer. You can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone.
* `allocation_id` - (Optional) The allocation ID of the Elastic IP address.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the arguments listed above:

* `id` - The ARN of the load balancer (matches `arn`).
* `arn` - The ARN of the load balancer (matches `id`).
* `arn_suffix` - The ARN suffix for use with CloudWatch Metrics.
* `dns_name` - The DNS name of the load balancer.
* `zone_id` - The canonical hosted zone ID of the load balancer (to be used in a Route 53 Alias record).

## Timeouts

`aws_lb` provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - (Default `10 minutes`) Used for Creating LB
- `update` - (Default `10 minutes`) Used for LB modifications
- `delete` - (Default `10 minutes`) Used for destroying LB

## Import

LBs can be imported using their ARN, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_lb.bar arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188
```
