Provides a budgets budget resource. Budgets use the cost visualisation provided by Cost Explorer to show you the status of your budgets, to provide forecasts of your estimated costs, and to track your AWS usage, including your free tier usage.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_budgets_budget" "ec2" {
  name              = "budget-ec2-monthly"
  budget_type       = "COST"
  limit_amount      = "1200"
  limit_unit        = "USD"
  time_period_end   = "2087-06-15_00:00"
  time_period_start = "2017-07-01_00:00"
  time_unit         = "MONTHLY"

  cost_filters = {
    Service = "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute"
  }

  notification {
    comparison_operator        = "GREATER_THAN"
    threshold                  = 100
    threshold_type             = "PERCENTAGE"
    notification_type          = "FORECASTED"
    subscriber_email_addresses = ["test@example.com"]
  }
}
```

Create a budget for *$100*.

```hcl
resource "aws_budgets_budget" "cost" {
  # ...
  budget_type  = "COST"
  limit_amount = "100"
  limit_unit   = "USD"
}
```

Create a budget for s3 with a limit of *3 GB* of storage.

```hcl
resource "aws_budgets_budget" "s3" {
  # ...
  budget_type  = "USAGE"
  limit_amount = "3"
  limit_unit   = "GB"
}
```
