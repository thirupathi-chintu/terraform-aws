# Resource: aws_ecs_service

-> **Note:** To prevent a race condition during service deletion, make sure to set `depends_on` to the related `aws_iam_role_policy`; otherwise, the policy may be destroyed too soon and the ECS service will then get stuck in the `DRAINING` state.

Provides an ECS service - effectively a task that is expected to run until an error occurs or a user terminates it (typically a webserver or a database).

See [ECS Services section in AWS developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_service" "mongo" {
  name            = "mongodb"
  cluster         = "${aws_ecs_cluster.foo.id}"
  task_definition = "${aws_ecs_task_definition.mongo.arn}"
  desired_count   = 3
  iam_role        = "${aws_iam_role.foo.arn}"
  depends_on      = ["aws_iam_role_policy.foo"]

  ordered_placement_strategy {
    type  = "binpack"
    field = "cpu"
  }

  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = "${aws_lb_target_group.foo.arn}"
    container_name   = "mongo"
    container_port   = 8080
  }

  placement_constraints {
    type       = "memberOf"
    expression = "attribute:ecs.availability-zone in [us-west-2a, us-west-2b]"
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Changes to Desired Count

You can utilize the generic Terraform resource [lifecycle configuration block](/docs/configuration/resources.html#lifecycle) with `ignore_changes` to create an ECS service with an initial count of running instances, then ignore any changes to that count caused externally (e.g. Application Autoscaling).

```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_service" "example" {
  # ... other configurations ...

  # Example: Create service with 2 instances to start
  desired_count = 2

  # Optional: Allow external changes without Terraform plan difference
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = ["desired_count"]
  }
}
```

### Daemon Scheduling Strategy

```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_service" "bar" {
  name                = "bar"
  cluster             = "${aws_ecs_cluster.foo.id}"
  task_definition     = "${aws_ecs_task_definition.bar.arn}"
  scheduling_strategy = "DAEMON"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the service (up to 255 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores)
* `task_definition` - (Required) The family and revision (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition that you want to run in your service.
* `desired_count` - (Optional) The number of instances of the task definition to place and keep running. Defaults to 0. Do not specify if using the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy.
* `launch_type` - (Optional) The launch type on which to run your service. The valid values are `EC2` and `FARGATE`. Defaults to `EC2`.
* `platform_version` - (Optional) The platform version on which to run your service. Only applicable for `launch_type` set to `FARGATE`. Defaults to `LATEST`. More information about Fargate platform versions can be found in the [AWS ECS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).
* `scheduling_strategy` - (Optional) The scheduling strategy to use for the service. The valid values are `REPLICA` and `DAEMON`. Defaults to `REPLICA`. Note that [*Fargate tasks do not support the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html).
* `cluster` - (Optional) ARN of an ECS cluster
* `iam_role` - (Optional) ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is required if you are using a load balancer with your service, but only if your task definition does not use the `awsvpc` network mode. If using `awsvpc` network mode, do not specify this role. If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here.
* `deployment_controller` - (Optional) Configuration block containing deployment controller configuration. Defined below.
* `deployment_maximum_percent` - (Optional) The upper limit (as a percentage of the service's desiredCount) of the number of running tasks that can be running in a service during a deployment. Not valid when using the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy.
* `deployment_minimum_healthy_percent` - (Optional) The lower limit (as a percentage of the service's desiredCount) of the number of running tasks that must remain running and healthy in a service during a deployment.
* `enable_ecs_managed_tags` - (Optional) Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service.
* `propagate_tags` - (Optional) Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks. The valid values are `SERVICE` and `TASK_DEFINITION`.
* `ordered_placement_strategy` - (Optional) Service level strategy rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. List from top to bottom in order of precedence. The maximum number of `ordered_placement_strategy` blocks is `5`. Defined below.
* `health_check_grace_period_seconds` - (Optional) Seconds to ignore failing load balancer health checks on newly instantiated tasks to prevent premature shutdown, up to 2147483647. Only valid for services configured to use load balancers.
* `load_balancer` - (Optional) A load balancer block. Load balancers documented below.
* `placement_constraints` - (Optional) rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. Maximum number of
`placement_constraints` is `10`. Defined below.
* `network_configuration` - (Optional) The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it is not supported for other network modes.
* `service_registries` - (Optional) The service discovery registries for the service. The maximum number of `service_registries` blocks is `1`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags

## deployment_controller

The `deployment_controller` configuration block supports the following:

* `type` - (Optional) Type of deployment controller. Valid values: `CODE_DEPLOY`, `ECS`. Default: `ECS`.

## load_balancer

`load_balancer` supports the following:

* `elb_name` - (Required for ELB Classic) The name of the ELB (Classic) to associate with the service.
* `target_group_arn` - (Required for ALB/NLB) The ARN of the Load Balancer target group to associate with the service.
* `container_name` - (Required) The name of the container to associate with the load balancer (as it appears in a container definition).
* `container_port` - (Required) The port on the container to associate with the load balancer.

-> **Note:** As a result of an AWS limitation, a single `load_balancer` can be attached to the ECS service at most. See [related docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html#load-balancing-concepts).

## ordered_placement_strategy

`ordered_placement_strategy` supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) The type of placement strategy. Must be one of: `binpack`, `random`, or `spread`
* `field` - (Optional) For the `spread` placement strategy, valid values are `instanceId` (or `host`,
 which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance.
 For the `binpack` type, valid values are `memory` and `cpu`. For the `random` type, this attribute is not
 needed. For more information, see [Placement Strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PlacementStrategy.html).

-> **Note:** for `spread`, `host` and `instanceId` will be normalized, by AWS, to be `instanceId`. This means the statefile will show `instanceId` but your config will differ if you use `host`.

## placement_constraints

`placement_constraints` support the following:

* `type` - (Required) The type of constraint. The only valid values at this time are `memberOf` and `distinctInstance`.
* `expression` -  (Optional) Cluster Query Language expression to apply to the constraint. Does not need to be specified
for the `distinctInstance` type.
For more information, see [Cluster Query Language in the Amazon EC2 Container
Service Developer
Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-query-language.html).

## network_configuration

`network_configuration` support the following:

* `subnets` - (Required) The subnets associated with the task or service.
* `security_groups` - (Optional) The security groups associated with the task or service. If you do not specify a security group, the default security group for the VPC is used.
* `assign_public_ip` - (Optional) Assign a public IP address to the ENI (Fargate launch type only). Valid values are `true` or `false`. Default `false`.

For more information, see [Task Networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)

## service_registries

`service_registries` support the following:

* `registry_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the Service Registry. The currently supported service registry is Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming Service(`aws_service_discovery_service`). For more information, see [Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_autonaming_Service.html)
* `port` - (Optional) The port value used if your Service Discovery service specified an SRV record.
* `container_port` - (Optional) The port value, already specified in the task definition, to be used for your service discovery service.
* `container_name` - (Optional) The container name value, already specified in the task definition, to be used for your service discovery service.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the service
* `name` - The name of the service
* `cluster` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of cluster which the service runs on
* `iam_role` - The ARN of IAM role used for ELB
* `desired_count` - The number of instances of the task definition

## Import
