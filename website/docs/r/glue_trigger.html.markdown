## Example Usage

### Conditional Trigger

```hcl
resource "aws_glue_trigger" "example" {
  name = "example"
  type = "CONDITIONAL"

  actions {
    job_name = "${aws_glue_job.example1.name}"
  }

  predicate {
    conditions {
      job_name = "${aws_glue_job.example2.name}"
      state    = "SUCCEEDED"
    }
  }
}
```

### On-Demand Trigger

```hcl
resource "aws_glue_trigger" "example" {
  name = "example"
  type = "ON_DEMAND"

  actions {
    job_name = "${aws_glue_job.example.name}"
  }
}
```

### Scheduled Trigger

```hcl
resource "aws_glue_trigger" "example" {
  name     = "example"
  schedule = "cron(15 12 * * ? *)"
  type     = "SCHEDULED"

  actions {
    job_name = "${aws_glue_job.example.name}"
  }
}
```
