  name = "test-group"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "policy" {
  name        = "test-policy"
  description = "A test policy"
  policy      = ""              # insert policy here
}

resource "aws_iam_group_policy_attachment" "test-attach" {
  group      = "${aws_iam_group.group.name}"
  policy_arn = "${aws_iam_policy.policy.arn}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `group`  (Required) - The group the policy should be applied to
* `policy_arn`  (Required) - The ARN of the policy you want to apply
