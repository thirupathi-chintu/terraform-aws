## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_gamelift_game_session_queue" "test" {
  name = "example-session-queue"

  destinations = [
    "${aws_gamelift_fleet.us_west_2_fleet.arn}",
    "${aws_gamelift_fleet.eu_central_1_fleet.arn}",
  ]

  player_latency_policy {
    maximum_individual_player_latency_milliseconds = 100
    policy_duration_seconds                        = 5
  }

  player_latency_policy {
    maximum_individual_player_latency_milliseconds = 200
  }

  timeout_in_seconds = 60
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the session queue.

* `destinations` - (Optional) List of fleet/alias ARNs used by session queue for placing game sessions.
* `player_latency_policy` - (Optional) One or more policies used to choose fleet based on player latency. See below.

### Nested Fields

* `maximum_individual_player_latency_milliseconds` - (Required) Maximum latency value that is allowed for any player.
* `policy_duration_seconds` - (Optional) Length of time that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. Absence of value for this attribute means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.
