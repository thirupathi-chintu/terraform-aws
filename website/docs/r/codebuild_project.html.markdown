# Resource: aws_codebuild_project

Provides a CodeBuild Project resource. See also the [`aws_codebuild_webhook` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/codebuild_webhook.html), which manages the webhook to the source (e.g. the "rebuild every time a code change is pushed" option in the CodeBuild web console).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "example" {
  name = "example"

  assume_role_policy = <<EOF

        "Service": "codebuild.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
