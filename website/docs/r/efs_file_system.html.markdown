# Resource: aws_efs_file_system

Provides an Elastic File System (EFS) resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "foo" {
  creation_token = "my-product"

  tags = {
    Name = "MyProduct"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `creation_token` - (Optional) A unique name (a maximum of 64 characters are allowed)
used as reference when creating the Elastic File System to ensure idempotent file
system creation. By default generated by Terraform. See [Elastic File System]
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/) user guide for more information.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) If true, the disk will be encrypted.
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) The ARN for the KMS encryption key. When specifying kms_key_id, encrypted needs to be set to true.
* `performance_mode` - (Optional) The file system performance mode. Can be either `"generalPurpose"` or `"maxIO"` (Default: `"generalPurpose"`).
* `provisioned_throughput_in_mibps` - (Optional) The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for the file system. Only applicable with `throughput_mode` set to `provisioned`.
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the file system.
* `throughput_mode` - (Optional) Throughput mode for the file system. Defaults to `bursting`. Valid values: `bursting`, `provisioned`. When using `provisioned`, also set `provisioned_throughput_in_mibps`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name of the file system.
* `id` - The ID that identifies the file system (e.g. fs-ccfc0d65).
* `dns_name` - The DNS name for the filesystem per [documented convention](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-mount-cmd-dns-name.html).

## Import

The EFS file systems can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_efs_file_system.foo fs-6fa144c6
```
