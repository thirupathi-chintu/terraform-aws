# Resource: aws_datasync_location_efs

Manages an AWS DataSync EFS Location.

~> **NOTE:** The EFS File System must have a mounted EFS Mount Target before creating this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_datasync_location_efs" "example" {
  # The below example uses aws_efs_mount_target as a reference to ensure a mount target already exists when resource creation occurs.
  # You can accomplish the same behavior with depends_on or an aws_efs_mount_target data source reference.
  efs_file_system_arn = "${aws_efs_mount_target.example.file_system_arn}"

  ec2_config {
    security_group_arns = ["${aws_security_group.example.arn}"]
    subnet_arn          = "${aws_subnet.example.arn}"
  }
}
```
