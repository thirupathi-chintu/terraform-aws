Provides a Route 53 Resolver endpoint resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_route53_resolver_endpoint" "foo" {
  name      = "foo"
  direction = "INBOUND"

  security_group_ids = [
    "${aws_security_group.sg1.id}",
    "${aws_security_group.sg2.id}",
  ]

  ip_address {
    subnet_id = "${aws_subnet.sn1.id}"
  }

  ip_address {
    subnet_id = "${aws_subnet.sn2.id}"
    ip        = "10.0.64.4"
  }

  tags {
    Environment = "Prod"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

Valid values are `INBOUND` (resolver forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network or another VPC)
or `OUTBOUND` (resolver forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network or another VPC).
* `ip_address` - (Required) The subnets and IP addresses in your VPC that you want DNS queries to pass through on the way from your VPCs
to your network (for outbound endpoints) or on the way from your network to your VPCs (for inbound endpoints). Described below.
* `security_group_ids` - (Required) The ID of one or more security groups that you want to use to control access to this VPC.
* `name` - (Optional) The friendly name of the Route 53 Resolver endpoint.
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

The `ip_address` object supports the following:

* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the subnet that contains the IP address.
* `ip` - (Optional) The IP address in the subnet that you want to use for DNS queries.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Route 53 Resolver endpoint.
* `arn` - The ARN of the Route 53 Resolver endpoint.
* `host_vpc_id` - The ID of the VPC that you want to create the resolver endpoint in.
